### Step 3 : Creating resource configuration files

1. Copy the resource files from my [repository](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/tree/main/Application%20Deployment) and paste them as I have done.
2. It is important to create new files for each individual resource; do not paste every resource into a single file.
3. You can customize each file as needed.
4. Copy [variable.tf](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/blob/main/Application%20Deployment/variables.tf) and paste it into a new file named variables.tf.
5. Create a terraform.tfvars file and assign values to variables like [this](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/blob/main/Application%20Deployment/terraform.tfvars).
6. Finally, your folder should resemble the picture below.
7. One thing to remember , we didn't hardcode any values in these resource files and we will provide values as shown in the following [Step 4](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/blob/main/variables.md) .
