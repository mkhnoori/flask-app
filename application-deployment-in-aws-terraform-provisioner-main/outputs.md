### Step 6 : Getting a Link as Output

1. We don't need to access the console to obtain the IP address of our instance.
2. We can retrieve the IP address in link format, making it accessible for use in a web browser.
3. Navigate to the folder where we created the resource, variables, and providers files.
4. Create a new file named *[outputs.tf](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/blob/main/Application%20Deployment/outputs.tf)* and copy the code from the 'outputs.tf' file in my repository.
5. Then, paste the copied code into the file.
