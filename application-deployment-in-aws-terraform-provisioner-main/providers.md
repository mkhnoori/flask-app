### Step 2 : Install the neccessary plugins

1. Create a new directory in your IDE and navigate to that directory. Then, create a new file.
2. Copy the file [provider.tf](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/blob/main/Application%20Deployment/provider.tf) and paste it into your new file, naming it provider.tf.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command:
```
terraform init
