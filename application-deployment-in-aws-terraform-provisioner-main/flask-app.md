### Step 5 : Flask Application 

1. After completing Step 4, we need to deploy our Flask app's source code.
2. Create a new directory and, within that directory, create a new file named 'app.py.'
3. Copy the code from the [app.py](https://github.com/mathesh-me/application-deployment-in-aws-terraform/blob/main/Flask%20Application/app.py) file from my repository and paste it into your 'app.py' file.
4. In my case, I am creating a simple Flask web app, but you can tailor it to your specific needs.
5. In my scenario, to run the web app, I need to include an 'index.html' file. Therefore, I created a new folder named 'templates' and placed a new 'index.html' file inside it.
